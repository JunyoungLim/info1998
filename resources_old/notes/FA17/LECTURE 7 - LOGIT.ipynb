    "In the cell above, we create X so that it contains all features except for the target variable, and we'll make predictions using X. This doesn't have to be the case, and in fact is usually not the best practice; we can pick features that we think are significant rather than using the entire dataset, and doing so often results in more accurate predictions. For simplicity's sake, however, we omit this in this example. "
