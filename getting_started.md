To work on the assignments and project, you will need to have a proper setup for development environment. If you do not already have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you will need to configure conda environment. Think of Jupyter Notebook as a playground where we can write codes, instantly print out outputs, embed images and markdowns, and easily share across. The following guide will help you install and setup your environment properly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Which version of Python do I need?
Both Python2 and Python3 work well with Jupyter Notebook and Machine Learning libraries, but for this course, we will use Python3. Any version of Python above 3.5.x will work with the course. You can verify the

```bash
$ brew install python
```
