This demo is still tentative! We are planning to add more descriptions about the algorithms and links to lecture notes and videos in the future.
More demos are coming, including decision trees and KNN.

Click the button "iterate," and it will show you how a perceptron algorithm learns and updates its weight to adjust the hyperplane. Red-marked points are the ones misclassified. Click until the perceptron converges and classifies every point correctly.
