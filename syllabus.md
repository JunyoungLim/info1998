### Catalog description

1 credit.  S/U Only. When you finish this program, you will have the foundation and basic
skills to contribute to any subteam in Cornell Data Science. This program introduces
various machine learning algorithms, model optimization, visualization techniques, and
data manipulation strategies, with applications in the Python programming language. The
program is open to all Cornell students across all departments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Prerequisites

One programming course or equivalent programming experience. Preferrably **CS 1110** as a
pre/co-requisite. No previous knowledge of Machine Learning or expertise in any particular
language is assumed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course technologies

- We will be working together on in-class assignments/exercises during lectures, so please
bring a laptop (or tablet) to fully participate.
- You will need a conda environment and/or virtualenv setup with necessary Python libraries.
- Please refer to the [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting_started.md %})
page for more information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Class material

Class material will be posted on our course website, including the assignments, lecture
slides, notes, and demos.

We will use CMS for assignment / project submissions and feedbacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course work

#### In-class assignments

There will be one in-class assignment per lecture, **10 total** throughout the semester.
All assignments will be done individually.
The assignment will be released at the beginning of the lecture (5pm EST on Wednesday),
and will be due **5pm EST on Friday** through CMS. Each assignment is of reasonable length
that you will be able to finish it by end of each lecture, but never force yourself to
finish it quickly, and don't let it disturb you from lecture!

#### Feedback and Grade Postings

We will be providing you with feedback on the Cornell University Course Management System
([CMS](https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/)). We will grade your work as soon as reasonably possible,
latest by Sunday midnight.

#### Grading
There are three components to grading:
- **Attendance**: Out of 10 lectures, you should attend at least 7 to pass.
Attendance will be accounted through in-class assignment submissions.
- **Assignments**: Out of 10 in-class assignments, you should submit and get a passing grade
on at least 7. Each assignment will be graded based on completion with sufficient amount of effort.
- **Project**: There will be an open-ended final project near the end of the semester as part of
CDS Hackathon. You will need to choose your own competition / research topic and form a group to
work together. Project will be graded based on completion with sufficient amount of effort, and
the top teams will receive prize.
